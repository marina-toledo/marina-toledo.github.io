    <div class="modal-body">
    This portfolio started with Udacity's course "Intro to HTML and CSS".<br><br>
    The technologies used to build was HTML5, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap and JQuery frameworks.<br><br>
    Perfomance was enhanced with minification of scripts, compressing images, use of CDN and with the help of Google's tool in https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=pt-BR<br><br>
    Responsiveness was a priority to the construction of this website, since it is important to a website to work in many devices, from a small phone to a big desktop screen.<br><br>
    But keep in mind that this website is still under construction and it's going to get much better.<br>
